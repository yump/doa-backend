We probably want enhanced response cal

Useful commands

*RST   #reset
*OPC?  #wait for commands to finish

DISPlay:ENABle <bool> # disabling the display makes SCPI faster
FORMat:DATA <char> # Binary (fast) or ascii (slow)

INITiate:CONTinuous <bool> # off for single sweep; setting to off is asynchronous
INITiate:IMMediate         # trigger a sweep; asynchronous
INITiate:RESTart           # trigger a multisweep (with trace averaging), or reset average in cont sweep

Smaple command should probably be INIT;*OPC?

INSTrument:SELect <CAT/NA/SA/VVM/Power Meter> # mode select; asynchronous

:SENSe:AVERage:mode <char> # set and query the averging mode for NA mode

CALCulate:SELected:FORMat <char>  # NA mode, PHASe or UPHase for phase measurement

:SENSe:SWEep:POINts <num>        #number of points in sweep

CALCulate:SELected:DATA:SDATa/     # Send and read the selected trace data - unformatted
CALCulate:SELected:DATA:FDATa     # Send and read the selected trace data - formatted

CALCulate:PARameter<tr>:DEFine <char> # set measurement mode for trace <tr> see FFProgramming pg 99

:BWID <num> #might be useful for more narrowband measurements.  minimum is 300, max is 30k  More bandwidth is faster
            # actually about the same for 3 points, though
