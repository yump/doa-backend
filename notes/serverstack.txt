acquisitionServer communicates with the network analyzer, with the
server, and with Ryan's arduino cluster.

## Radio interface

class radio:
	sample()
		should return samples?  Or store them inside?  What if the radio
		has internal memory of some kind?  Then it would certainly be
		best to support some kind of remote buffering.
	trigger()
	getsome(max)
	getall()
		That could work.  The generic radio class could provide versions
		that would just use sample() and an internal buffer for radios
		that don't have useful internal memory.

## Data Hierarchy

session
	arraysamples = list()
		arraysample[0] - dict mapping antenna_ids to samples
			{0: Sample, 2:, Sample, 4: Sample}
				Sample = namedtuple("Sample", ["timestamp","i","q"])
		arraysample[1]...
			...
